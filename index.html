                    <h3>Boyz on foot vs. in a Transport</h3>
                    <p>Having always been a fan of the Ork horde in movies and books and video games, its no wonder that I play Warhammer 40k the same way.
                        The tactics for this to be effective have changed over the years as the rules have changed. As it stands now, transports are effective
                        at keeping your boyz alive and delivering them to the enemies gates where they can do the most damage. Orks have one of the most durable 
                        transports in the game right now in the Battlewagon. At 16 wounds and a 20 boy capacity, it can also be kitted to deal out some serious 
                        firepower. Trukks are the other option and while cheap, they are not nearly as durable. They have a nice ability in ramshackle but it's not
                        something that should be relied on. The major pitfall of these transports is their carrying ability. The Battlewagon carries 20 and the 
                        trukk carries 12. To be effective, Orks need maxed out squads right now which is 30. This makes their leadership basically a non-issue 
                        and they can hit like a train in HtH. Orks excel in foot-slogging horde mode right now so if you take transports, it will be to drive around
                        units that can shoot on the move or to shotgun Nobz in your enemies face.

                    <h3>Trukks vs. Battlewagons</h3>
                    <p>Trukks are better than ever. They are quick and open-topped so their ocupants can shoot while embarked. With 10 wounds and a 4+ save they are 
                        not the most durable transport. Ramshackle helps them survive, turning damage higher than 1 into a 1 on a roll of 6+ but its not something 
                        your boyz can rely on. Right now they drive my Tankbustas around the field because they are a cheap way to put a shield around a valuable unit. 
                        Battlewagons are monsters. With the capability to take 4 rokkits or big shootas <em>AND</em> a Killkannon, they can pack a punch. The deffrolla 
                        is also back and lets the Battlewagon engage the enemy effectively in HtH. Holding up to 20 models means this is the perfect delivery for my 
                        Nob squad to ride in. You have the option of taking them open-topped or with a 'Ard Case. The 'Ard Case is free and brings your toughness up to 
                        8 so its a no brainer to take it. The Nobz won't be super effective with shooting out of it anyway. Best to get up in the enemies' faces and krump
                        them gud!

                    <h3>Tankbustas!!</h3>
                    <p>Tankbustas are one of the best ork units right now. They are normal boyz but they all have rokkit launchas. At Str 8, AP -2, and D 3 there is not 
                        much the tankbustas have trouble bringing down. Their special ability, however, is where they really shine. They can reroll failed to hit rolls 
                        when shooting at a vehicle. With a BS 5+ the reroll ensures they get enough hits in to bring down their target! Throw them in a Trukk or Battlewagon 
                        to have a super mobile armor deleting unit in your army!

                    <h3>Grots?</h3>
                    <p>Grots are the wimpiest beings in the ork world and it's no different on the tabletop. What they are best for is sitting on objectives in your back lines 
                        as well as potentially soaking up overwatch on a charge. Operation Meat Shield is a real thing in grot life. Being extremely cheap is their main 
                        advantage. I usually run one minimum squad to get objectives but I have see some successes from others using them maxed out and on the front lines 
                        just being a nusance to the enemy.

                    <h3>Ghazghkull Mag Uruk Thraka</h3>
                    <p>The Ork, The Myth, The Legend. This guy is a destroyer of worlds. Helping keep his already beastly stat line alive and bashing heads on the field 
                        he sports a 2+ save and 4+ invulnerable save. Throw in a Painboy and Tenacious survivor and he will tank some serious damage before falling. If that
                        weren't enough, he boosts the boyz around him as well. The boyz within 6" will have +1 to their ATK characteristic when they charge and allows the 
                        boys to charge <strong>EVEN</strong> though they already advanced! Ghazghkull wants the boyz to cover ground quickly to get stuck in and his ability 
                        is perfect for that.

                    <h3>Grizgutz</h3>
                    <p>This Ork Warlord led his WAAAGH!!! into the Morloq system. Using warp travel, Grizgutz and his boyz teleported and when they came out of the warp 
                        Grizgutz realized he had traveled back in time to shortly before he was about to leave on his conquest. Being a kleptomaniac, Grizgutz decended on 
                        his own planet and killed himself to claim his own gun as a backup gun. The resulting confusion, however, sent his boys into a fury and the WAAAGH!!!
                        was sent into disarray.

                    <h3>Tuska, Daemon-Killa</h3>
                    <p>Tuska led his WAAAGH!!! into the Eye of Terror and made his name by defeating Daemon hordes on many Daemon worlds. His WAAAGH!!! came to an end when he 
                        landed on a flesh planet belonging to a Daemon Prince of Khorne known as the Blood Prince. After an epic battle, Tuska was finally slain by the wrathful 
                        Blood Prince. However, his story does not end there. The chaos God, Khorne, loved the battle so much he resurrected the Ork horde the next dawn to fight 
                        again. Now Tuska and his most battle hardened Nobz fight daily in the Brass Citadel against Khorne's elite Bloodletter generals.
